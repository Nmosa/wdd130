        <p> Hello! My name is Nmesoma Nwaeze and I am from Aba,Abia State,Nigeria. I find it a delight to tell
            people about my heritage. I am Igbo and the Igbo people are one of the wealthiest Black Race on Earth
            boasting of many millionaires than in any black nation around the world. I hope you will eventually come
            to visit the South-South and South-East regions of Nigeria to experience first hand what I mean by what
            I said. I'm ever ready to be your non-paid guide. Catch you soon. Before I forget, I will introduce
            myself as a student of Software Development of Brigham Young University-Idaho and I'm elated about how
            amazing the knowledge I gain. I'm looking forward to creating my own website and at last live my
            dreamlife of being a Software Developer. </p>

        <P> Abuja lies in the heart of Nigeria and serves the nation as the Capital. Abuja is a land blessed with
            beautiful nature and is home to diverse walks of life; a place where cultures and religions coexists and
            thrive regardless of differences. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has many adherants in
            Abuja and there is currently a temple that has been announced by President Nelson.</P>
